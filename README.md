# Project Change Request-PCR-

FMJ2 did the following: FMJ2 Net Shield team developed a comprehensive Security Hardening Plan for Design World's cloud environment. The plan included specific actions to address vulnerabilities identified in previous assessments, such as patching, configuration changes, and security control implementations. Additionally, a Project Change Request (PCR) was created to document proposed changes to the project scope, timeline, or budget to accommodate the security enhancements. 

FMJ2 did this because of this: The goal was to provide Design World with a detailed roadmap for systematically improving the security posture of their cloud environment. The PCR ensured that necessary adjustments were made to the project to accommodate the security initiatives. 

FMJ2 outcome was that: The Security Hardening Plan outlined a series of actionable steps, prioritized based on risk and potential impact. The PCR detailed the proposed changes to the project, explaining how they align with the organization's security goals. 

The next logical step is: To present the Security Hardening Plan and Project Change Request to Design World's management for approval and subsequent implementation.
